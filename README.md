## Notebooks Overview

This project includes the following Jupyter notebooks, presented in the order they should be explored:

- **Assignment1.ipynb** (Basic Python Foundations)
  - Covers fundamental Python concepts, data structures, and simple scripting exercises.

- **Q_2.ipynb** (Air Quality Analysis)
  - Performs exploratory data analysis on the UCI Air Quality dataset, including timeâ€‘series visualizations, missing value handling, and pollutant correlation studies.

- **Question1.ipynb** / **Q_1.ipynb** (Red Wine Quality Prediction)
  - Conducts EDA on the red wine quality dataset, visualizes physicochemical properties versus quality, and builds regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict wine quality.
